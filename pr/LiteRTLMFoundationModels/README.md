# LiteRTLMFoundationModels — lean Apple Foundation Models backend (upstream-PR candidate)

This is the **minimal** Apple Foundation Models backend for LiteRT-LM, carved out
of `swift-litert-lm` so it can be proposed upstream to
[`google-ai-edge/litert-lm`](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/litert-lm)'s Swift
API. It compiles against **only the LiteRT-LM core Swift wrapper** (`LiteRTLM` —
`Engine` / `Conversation` / `Message` / …) plus Apple's `FoundationModels`.

`swift build` here proves exactly that: no app dependencies, no core changes.

## What it is

`LiteRTLanguageModel` conforms to the iOS 27 `LanguageModel` protocol, so a
LiteRT-LM model drives a stock `LanguageModelSession` — alongside Apple's own
conformers `SystemLanguageModel` (on-device) and `PrivateCloudComputeLanguageModel`.

```swift
import FoundationModels
import LiteRTLM
import LiteRTLMFoundationModels

let cfg     = try EngineConfig(modelPath: path, backend: .gpu)   // existing core API
let model   = LiteRTLanguageModel(engineConfig: cfg)             // <- the adapter
let session = LanguageModelSession(model: model)                 // Apple's exact API

let answer  = try await session.respond(to: "Explain on-device AI in one sentence.")
```

It provides:

- `respond` / `streamResponse` (text)
- image attachments (FM's native `AttachmentSegment`)
- `@Generable` guided generation (schema-in-prompt → JSON extraction)
- `Tool` calling (emits `ToolCalls` events; FM runs the tool and re-invokes)
- audio / video understanding via `LiteRTAudioSegment` / `LiteRTVideoSegment`
  (`Transcript.CustomSegment` — FM has no native audio/video segment)

## Design (why it's mergeable)

- **Core-only deps.** Uses just the existing public `Engine` / `EngineConfig` /
  `Conversation` / `Message` / `SamplerConfig` / `Backend` / `ExperimentalFlags` /
  `Tool` API. **No changes to the core are required.**
- **Zero impact on other platforms.** Everything is wrapped in
  `#if canImport(FoundationModels)` + `@available(iOS 27.0, macOS 27.0, *)`, so on
  Linux / Android / Windows it compiles to nothing. For the actual PR these files
  become a gated module/target inside the upstream Swift package (no manifest
  product needed — or an optional `LiteRTLM-FoundationModels` target if preferred).
- **Transcript bridge.** The FM API is transcript-based (each turn hands the
  executor the full conversation); LiteRT-LM is stateful. We rebuild a fresh
  LiteRT `Conversation` from the transcript per turn — correct and simple; an
  incremental KV fast-path is a later optimization.
- **One engine per model file.** `EngineCache` shares a single loaded engine per
  `Configuration` (keyed on `modelPath`). FM may build a second executor for a
  tool-enabled session; without sharing, the multi-GB weights would load twice
  and OOM. `LiteRTLanguageModel.releaseCachedEngines()` frees them.

## What is intentionally *not* here

These stay in the `swift-litert-lm` app layer — they're conveniences, not runtime
concerns:

- the model **downloader** (Hugging Face fetch) and **model catalog**
- `LiteRTChat` (the Easy-mode chat facade)
- `VideoFrameSampler` (AVFoundation frame extraction)

## Honest scope

- Guided generation and tool calling are **prompt-driven** (schema-in-prompt +
  JSON extraction), not hard constrained decoding. Reliable for simple/medium
  schemas on small models; a hard `llguidance` path is future work.
- Verified on device with Gemma 4 E2B (iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 27). Other models run
  through the same path but aren't individually verified.

## Suggested PR staging

1. **PR #1 (basic):** `respond` / `streamResponse` + image + guided + tools.
2. **Follow-up:** audio / video custom segments; incremental KV fast-path;
   optional hard-constrained decoding.

## Build

```bash
swift build        # from this directory; resolves the parent package's LiteRTLM core
```
